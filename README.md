# hamburger-ocr

This project is going to be my attempt at using ocr to read Moon Runes.
Not sure if its ready for others yet, I built it in Arch Linux.
Still some kinks to work out to make it user friendly.
This was a project for myself so that I could play some japanese games but I might spruce things up over time.

Dependencies are Leptonica, Tensorflow for the OCR
https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
Make sure to add horizontal Japanese model file to the correct directory.

and Python 3 and Python requests library ot run script that uses API for translation
